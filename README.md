# Cplusplus-Program

This was Project 2 of my CS210 class in which the code will calculate the bank balances with and without a monthly deposit being made additionally it will format a visual table to be seen based on the values input by the user. It is an application that allows users to see how their investments will grow over time.

I formatted and rendered the table that populates to give a graphic for the user to better see the investment growth over time. 
To make it more secure more efficient, I could add different code that shows different data also, by adding a way to export the data to a secure file for future use. The Most challenging part of this code was making the table even and getting the spacing the same for the two tables so it was aethetically pleasing. I think that the formulas used within this code is explicitly transferrable to other banking apps that could be made. In order to make this program maintainable I utilized simple functions that encapsulated the formulas within a header file as to not clog up the source.cpp file. To make it readable I used a generous amount of whitespace to break up the code and adaptable, because it is easily modifiable.

#To Help me with this Project
I used my peers in order to test this code and ensure that it was functioning as designed. 

#Transferrable skills 
Some skills used in building this project that could be transferred directly into others would be how to efficiently use math and C++ in order to design a smooth running application.
